Karandikar has been all over the repo, providing fixes and features. Happy to have him on board to make `react-boilerplate` even better!\n\nSpecial thanks as always to @gihrig for diligently testing everything and keeping our dependencies up to date!\n\nAlso, huge props to @samit4me and @Dattaya for being everywhere and fixing so many issues and of course to @KarandikarMihir for all his hard work.\n\nIf you want to help us make react-boilerplate great, please use the `dev` branch, test all the things and report all the bugs!\n\n### Supporters\n\nThis release was made possible by [Fullstack React](https://www.fullstackreact.com/) and [Serverless](http://serverless.com)! _Want to support us too? [Click here!](http://opencollective.com/react-boilerplate)_\n\n\n## RBP v3.0: The \"JS Fatigue Antivenin\" Edition\n\nReact Boilerplate (RBP) v3.0.0 is out, and it's a _complete_ rewrite! :tada:\n\nWe've focused on becoming a rock-solid foundation to start your next project\nwith, no matter what its scale. You get to focus on writing your app because we\nfocus on making that as easy as pie.\n\nwebsite!\n\n## Highlights\n\n- **Scaffolding**: Thanks to @somus, you can now run `npm run generate` in your\n  terminal and immediately create new components, containers, sagas, routes and\n  selectors! No more context switching, no more \"Create new file, copy and paste\n  that boilerplate structure, bla bla\": just `npm run generate <thing>` and go.\n\n  Oh... and starting a project got a whole lot easier too: `npm run setup`. Done.\n\n- **Revamped architecture**: Following the incredible discussion in #27 (thanks\n  everybody for sharing your thoughts), we now have a weapons-grade, domain-driven\n  application architecture.\n\n  \"Smart\" containers are now isolated from stateless and/or generic components,\n  tests are now co-located with the code that they validate.\n\n- **New industry-standard JS utilities** We're now making the most of...\n    - ImmutableJS\n    - reselect\n    - react-router-redux\n    - redux-saga\n\n- **Huge CSS Improvements**\n  - _[CSS Modules](docs/css/css-modules.md)_: Finally, truly modular, reusable\n    styles!\n  - _Page-specific CSS_: smart Webpack configuration means that only the CSS\n    your components need is served\n  - _Standards rock:_ Nothing beats consistent styling so we beefed up the\n    quality checks with **[stylelint](docs/css/stylelint.md)** to help ensure\n    that you and your team stay on point.\n\n- **Performance**\n  - _Code splitting_: splitting/chunking by route means the leanest, meanest\n    payload (because the fastest code is the code you don't load!)\n\n- **Testing setup**: Thanks to @jbinto's herculean efforts, testing is now a\n  first-class citizen of this boilerplate. (the example app has _99% test coverage!_)\n  Karma and enzyme take care of unit testing, while ngrok tunnels your local\n  server for access from anywhere in the world – perfect for testing on different\n  devices in different locations.\n\n- **New server setup**: Thanks to the mighty @grabbou, we now use express.js to\n  give users a production-ready server right out of the box. Hot reloading is\n  still as available as always, but adding a custom API or a non-React page to\n  your application is now easier than ever :smile:\n\n- **Cleaner layout:** We've taken no prisoners with our approach to keeping your\n  code the star of the show: wherever possible, the new file layout keeps the\n  config in the background so that you can keep your focus where it needs to be.\n\n- **Documentation**: Thanks to @oliverturner, this boilerplate has some of the best\n  documentation going. Not just clearly explained usage guides, but easy-to-follow\n  _removal_ guides for most features too. RBP is just a launchpad: don't want to\n  use a bundled feature? Get rid of it quickly and easily without having to dig\n  through the code.\n\n- **Countless small improvements**: Everything, from linting pre-commit (thanks\n  @okonet!) to code splitting to cross-OS compatibility is now tested and ready\n  to go:\n\n  - We finally added a **[CoC](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)**\n  - Windows compatibility has improved massively",
